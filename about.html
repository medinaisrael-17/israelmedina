                <p>
                    Hello, and welcome to my GitHub!

                    My name is Israel Medina and I am a Full-Stack developer who works well with others and looks
                    forward to any challenge thrown at him.

                    My experiences with computer science, such as school and personal studying, and leadership
                    opportunities, on projects and amongst my peers, has helped me prepare for many circumstances in the
                    tech industry and in life. Iâ€™ve found my strengths to be what I enjoy most such as Javascript, like
                    creating algorithms to efficiently solve problems and CSS where I get to explore my creative side
                    and appeal to the aesthetics of modern web development. I also enjoy working with databases such as
                    MongoDB or Firebase that allow me to work with multiple data tables and relay that information to
                    the users.

                    Focused in full stack development with strengths being logic, communicating ideas and challenges
                    effectively to teammates. Looking to bring my creativity and a strong mind to the workplace to
                    create unique and useful apps.

                    Please explore my <a href="https://github.com/medinaisrael-17" target="_blank">GitHub</a> to see
                    some projects I've created and collaborated on.
