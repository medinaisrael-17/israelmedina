            <p>
                I'm Israel Medina! Houston born, but I am a Full Stack Developer located near the "Heart Of Texas". I
                love
                design, as much as my love for superheroes, and hold myself to a high standard when it comes to
                aesthetics.
                I went to Stony Point High School where I enveloped myself in music and leadership through the band. I
                became "Drum Major" my senior year to help lead the students throughout their marching season. Once
                graduating I decided to study Computer Science at Austin Community College and continue my love for
                music
                through the ACC Jazz Ensemble. I then studied Web Development through the University of Texas at Austin
                and walked away with a ton of information that has helped me create what you see before
                you.
                I was well able to complete my studies and offered to be a Teacher Assistant for my instructor to help
                teach
                the next set of fresh faces the world of "full stack full flex".
            </p>
            <p>
                That is where I am at today. Being a TA for
                the same boot camp I took has taught me even more than it did when I was a student. One of the biggest
                takeaways so far is how different EVERYBODY learns. Some of the students learn better visually, some
                learn
                better reading, in which case I will write "guides" or further instruction for them to look into
                subjects
                they might not grasp (such as JavaScript or REACT). Some students don't learn from either, and I spend
                some
                one on one time with the student in office hours to ensure the success of that student. I gauge my
                success
                on how well I can set up the students for success when they walk out of the classroom with their
                certificate. It has also taught me that if you can teach it, you can do it. With so many students in a
                cohort, I will often let them teach or guide other students who are having similar issues. This helps
                the
                student to further their grasp upon the concept that the class is currently learning. The cultivation of
                me
                learning computer science at ACC, my personal web development experience at UT Austin, and then becoming
                a
                TA has laid a solid foundation that I build my other abilities. My skills are reflected in my
                craftsmanship
                that is showcased on the portfolio page. The field of web development and software brings joy to me,
                whether
                it's designing the wireframe for a site using HTML with CSS, or using JavaScript to integrate users info
                from a database in the back end, I will take any task at 100%. I am always open to new ideas and meeting
                new
                people. I look forward to my future as a developer. I hope you enjoy your time on this site!
